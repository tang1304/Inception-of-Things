# Inception of Things

## Introduction

This project will consist of setting up several environments under specific rules.
It is divided into three parts you have to do in the following order:
• Part 1: K3s and Vagrant
• Part 2: K3s and three simple applications
• Part 3: K3d and Argo CD

### K3s

K3s is a Kubernetes distribution made by Rancher Labs. It is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution (compared to K8s) that is easy to install and use. Abscence of storage drivers and cloud. Docker needs to be installed if we want to use it.

### Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool used to automate the creation and deployment of virtual machines. Made by Hashicorp, which also made Terraform.

Define the configuration of a VM in a vagrantfile.
Can handle dependencies of a project, as libraries, DBs, etc.

	Vagrant.configure("2") do |	config|
		config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"
	end

Here, this simple vagrantfile only dwonloads an ubuntu box (like an image) and initializes it on a VM.

## Part 1: K3s and Vagrant

### Summary of Requirements

**Objective**: Set up 2 virtual machines using Vagrant and deploy K3s cluster

**Virtual Machine Specifications**:
- **Resources**: Minimal configuration (1 CPU, 512MB-1024MB RAM)
- **OS**: Latest stable distribution of your choice
- **Provider**: Vagrant

**Machine Configuration**:
1. **Server Machine**:
   - Name: `[team_login]S` (e.g., `wilS`)
   - Hostname: Same as name
   - IP: `192.168.56.110` on eth1 interface
   - Role: K3s controller/server mode

2. **Worker Machine**:
   - Name: `[team_login]SW` (e.g., `wilSW`)
   - Hostname: Same as name  
   - IP: `192.168.56.111` on eth1 interface
   - Role: K3s agent/worker mode

**Network & Access**:
- Dedicated IP addresses on eth1 interface
- SSH access without password on both machines
- Follow modern Vagrantfile practices

**Software Installation**:
- K3s on both machines (server mode on first, agent mode on second)
- kubectl for cluster management

**Key Implementation Points**:
- Use proper Vagrant configuration syntax
- Implement shell provisioning for K3s installation
- Ensure proper networking between machines
- Configure K3s cluster connectivity (server-agent communication)

### Implementation Steps
1. Create Vagrantfile with two machine definitions
2. Configure networking and resource allocation
3. Set up provisioning scripts for K3s installation
4. Test cluster connectivity and kubectl functionality
